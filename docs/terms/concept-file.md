## Definition
A **concept-file** is a file that contains documentation about a specific [concept](concept). To faciliate authors, a self-explanatory [template file](/terminology-engine-v1-templates/concept-file.md) is available.

## Purpose
The ability for people to determine whether or not they are talking about the same 'thing' (idea, concept), is prerequisite for knowing that they (correctly) understand one another - which doesn't imply they agree with each other. Concept files provide the documentation of such [things](concept) that contribute to this ability.

## Criterion
a file that defines/specifies a concept.

## Examples
the file that contains this text is an example of a concept-file.
