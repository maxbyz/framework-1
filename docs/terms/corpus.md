## Definition
A **corpus** is a collection of (stored) texts that embody the [knowledge](knowledge) about [terminologies](terminology) (i.e. [terms](term), [concepts](concept), and [mental models](mental-model)) of various [scopes](scope). This collection is stored in a database-like fashion, meaning that it can be queried to obtain data representing selections of terms and their meaning, which can subsequently be used e.g. for the construction of [glossaries](glossary), [dictionaries](dictionary), or other artifacts.

The curators of a [terminology](terminology) are tasked with keeping their part of the corpus up to date. Ideally, this would result in a corpus that could be used to learn what terms mean in various scopes, where the meaning differs, resolve issues that such differences may have caused, and more.

## Purpose
The purpose of having a **corpus** is to enable the creation of terminological artifacts such as glossaries and dictionaries and other artifacts, e.g. that allow documents to be rendered in such a way that readers are supported in finding the meaning of a term as the author intended it.
