## Definition
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->
A Dictionary is an alphabetically sorted list of terms and explanations. Each term may have multiple such explanations, which come from different [scopes/contexts](scope).

The [terminology pattern](pattern-terminology) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

## Purpose
<!--Describe why the concept is needed. What purposes does it serve? What can you do with it that you cannot do (as well) without it? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this conceptevant within its scope of definition?-->
A dictionary helps people to get introduced in the domain for which the dictionary is created. Usually, this is a larger domain e.g. of some language, or about computer security.

## Criteria
<!--REQUIRED--How is this concept different from related ideas? What are essential characteristics that must be true? This is where you specify the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions) of the concept, i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. This makes that the conceptomes crystal clear. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.-->
an alphabetical list of words or phrases with possibly multiple, short explanations, that exists for the purpose of helping people to find out what a word may mean in various [scopes/contexts](scope).

## Examples
<!--This (optional) section contains examples, both of what satisfies the definition (and hence qualifies as an instance of Glossary), ans what does not. If you can think of examples for which the criterion may not (always) work, then describe them, too, and inform the reader why this hasn't affected the definition (yet) - e.g. because such cases are irrelevant to the scope within which the term is defined.-->
Examples include the [NIST Computer Security Resource Center](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary), [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/).

## Related Concepts
<!--This (optional) section lists words/phrases that are encountered in other contexts that have the same or a sufficiently similar meaning as Glossary. In this section you may point out the (subtle) differences between Glossary and this related terminology. This helps readers better/deeper understand Glossary, and how it may be used to relate to existing texts. Ideally, such references are accompanied with links to (preferredly authoritative) sources.-->
- [Glossary](glossary) - this is a list of words with a single meaning, that serves more specific purposes than a dictionary.
- [Vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary) - this is a set of familiar words witin a particular/persons's language or field of expertise. A Dictionary can provide the various meanings of each such words.

## Notes
<!--This (optional) section is the place to put anything for which there is no other good place to put it.-->
