## Governance
The [eSSIF-Lab project](https://essif-lab.eu/) governs the terminology within this scope, according to the procedures mentioned in the [eSSIF-Lab Framework](https://essif-lab.pages.grnet.gr/framework/docs/terminology/).

## Objectives/Issues
Contributors to and users of eSSIF-Lab come from various backgrounds. Their culture may not be Western. English may not be their native tongue. They may be experts in non-technological topics. Working with one another presumes a setting where participants have some level of shared understanding. Often, sharing one's understanding at a superficial level suffices. Other situations require that underlying concepts are shared in a more in-depth fashion. It's like cars: people buying, selling, or driving cars do not need in-depth shared knowledge about cars, whereas (maintenance or construction) engineers or liability lawyers need to share a deeper knowledge of how cars do (or do not) work.

We expect to see situations of "language confusion", i.e. in which people use words or phrases, the intension (not: intention) of which differs from the interpretation of some listeners/readers. Sometimes a casual glance at a dictionary or glossary is the solution. In other cases, deeper understanding matters, e.g. in when drafting specifications or contracts. Then we need more than a set of definitions.

The Concepts and Terminology part of eSSIF-Lab aims helps eSSIF-Lab community participants understand one another at whatever level of precision they need.

## Background
The [terminology pattern](pattern-terminology) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
