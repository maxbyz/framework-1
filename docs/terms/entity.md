## Definition
An entity is someone or something that some [party](party) knows to exist, be it some person, some computer, an extinct animal, a thought, an idea, a JSON-object, etc. Since parties have a limited [knowledge](knowledge), there are obviously entities that they have no knowledge about, while other parties do.

## Purpose
This term enables us to refer to anything, or to postulate the existence of something, without further specifying what it is, or how it might be named.

## Criterion
Something, anything, that some [party](party) knows to exist

## Related Concepts
