## Definition

**Ownership** is a relationship between two [entities](entity) in which one of these [entities](entity) (called the [owner](owner)) is entitled to enjoy, dispose of, and control the other [entity](entity) in an pretty much absolute (sovereign) fashion. Any ownership relationship is grounded in ((the rules of) the [legal system](legal-system) of) a specific [jurisdiction](jurisdiction), that maintains and enforces these rules, and that has means to resolve any disputes arising from that. To do this, both [entities](entity) must be [legal entities](legal-entity) in that [jurisdiction](jurisdiction).

We may use the phrase [natural ownership](ownership) to refer to an ownership relation that exists in the [jurisdiction](jurisdiction) 'Nature' (see the notes of [jurisdiction](jurisdiction)). This enables us to talk about things as 'the (natural) ownership of an [assertion](assertion)'.

## Purpose
**Ownership** is a means by which [jurisdictions](jurisdiction) provide assurances to [parties](party) (within its scope) that they can enjoy, dispose of and control in pretty much any way they like. The [legal system](legal-system) of the [jurisdiction](jurisdiction) specifies these rights, and provides ways in which the [owner](owner) can exercize them (that provides the assurance).

## Criteria
An **ownership** is a relationship between two [legal entities](legal-entity) (called the [owner](owner) and the [owned](owned)) within a single [jurisdiction](jurisdiction), whose [legal system](legal-system) defines and enforces (a) rules that recognize the power of the [owner](owner) to enjoy, dispose of and control the [owned](owned) in an absolute (sovereign) fashion, and (b) rules that limit the absoluteness of that power.

## Notes
- Owning something does not imply posessing it (and vice versa). For example, if you find a coin that doesn't belong to you, you possess it but do not own it. Also, its rightful owner obviously owns it, but doesn't possess it at that point in time.
- Ownership has no meaning outside of a [jurisdiction](jurisdiction) that defines *and* enforces the rights and duties of the owner to enjoy, dispose of, and control the owned.
