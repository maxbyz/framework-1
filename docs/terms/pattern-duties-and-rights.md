## Purpose

The **Duties-and-rights pattern** captures the concepts and relations that explain what (generic) duties and rights are, thereby following the [theory of Hohfeld](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/#FormRighHohfAnalSyst), which is not only the basis of [legal systems](legal-system) (in [jurisdictions](jurisdiction)), but can be used to generically model duties and rights.
