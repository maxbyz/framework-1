## Definition
A **scope-file** is a file that contains the specification of a specific [scope](scope). To faciliate authors, a self-explanatory [template file](/terminology-engine-v1-templates/scope-file.md) is available.

## Purpose
[Scopes](scope) enable people to focus, which is important as people's short-term memory is limited to 7 +/- 2 concepts (with attributes) [(Miller, 1956)](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/). Hence, defining a scope - what is in it and what is not - is relevant as well.

## Criterion
a file that defines/specifies a [scope](scope).
