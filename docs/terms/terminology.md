## Definition
A **terminology** is a set of words and phrases ([terms](term)) that are used within some [scope](scope) for reasoning and communicating about specific topics. To limit the probability of misunderstandings between parties as they reason or communicate with each other, each of these terms is associated with a [definition](definition) within that scope.

A terminology may be viewed as a topic-specific subset of the scope's [vocabulary](vocabulary).

A terminology may conveniently be documented in a [glossary](glossary).

## Purpose
In order for [parties](party) to properly reason and/or communicate ideas ([concepts](concept)) about some topic - in particular when it is a specialist topic - they have to establish a set of terms, the meaning of which should be [defined](definition) in such a way that the likelihood of misunderstandings between them is minimized: a `**terminology**`

## Criteria
A **terminology** is a set of [terms](term) that are used within some [scope](scope) by [parties](party) to reason and communicate about some specific topic(s) for the purpose of reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings.

## Examples
- The set of words listed in the [eSSIF-Lab glossary](../essifLab-glossary) are used within the eSSIF-Lab community for reasoning and communicating about topics that serve the [eSSIF-Lab Objectives](../essifLab-objectives), which is part of the `eSSIF-Lab terminology`.
- The set of words listed in the [Sovrin glossary](https://sovrin.org/library/glossary/) are used within the Sovrin Governance Framework and its Controlled Documents to understand the meaning of the terms that the authors intended to convey. Thus they comprise the `Sovrin terminology`.
